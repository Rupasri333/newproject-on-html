HTML | Attributes
An attribute is used to provide extra or additional information about an element.

All HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about an element.
It takes two parameters : a name and a value.
These define the properties of the element and is placed inside the opening tag of the element. 
The name parameter takes the name of the property we would like to assign to the element and the value takes the properties value or extent of the property names that can be aligned over the element.
Every name has some value that must be written within quotes.
Syntax:

<element attribute_name="attribute_value">
